We are creating an exercise app that will take the user's name, gender, age, weight, height, and exercise goals. The app will then recommend an exercise and provide an implementation of motion tracking code in order to assist the user. This currently comes in the form of a counter and form checker depending on the recommended exercise. 

requires:
pip install opencv-python
pip install streamlit
pip install mediapipe

TO RUN:
streamlit run main.py
